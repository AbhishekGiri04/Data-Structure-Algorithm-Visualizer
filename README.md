# Data-Structure-Algorithm-Visualizer
Developed a web-based DSA Visualizer using C (for logic), Flask (as backend), and HTML/CSS/JS (frontend). Visualizes Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, and Graph algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's) with 3D animations and time/space complexity charts via file I/O.
