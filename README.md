# Data-Structure-Algorithm-Visualizer
Developed a web-based Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer using C, Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in VS Code. The tool supports core data structures like Stack, Queue, Linked List, and Tree, along with graph algorithms such as Prim’s, Kruskal’s, and Dijkstra’s. Logic is written in C, with input/output handled via input.txt and output.txt, while Flask bridges the backend with a dynamic web interface. Real-time 3D animations and interactive charts display each operation's behavior and time-space complexity. The platform enables users to input data via the web, execute logic using compiled C programs, and visually observe algorithm steps, making it an effective educational and demonstrative tool. Built with a focus on performance, cross-language integration, and engaging user experience.
